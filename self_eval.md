# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
Hashes, specifically hashes_1, I don't know why that just was struggling to process but I was able to handle hashes with iterations.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
Note-taking is incredibly useful, especially in remembering vocab and jotting each piece down. It also helps to take the time to actually do the practices and learn what its teaching you and note-taking encourages you process the information thoroughly.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I try several times to solve my code on my own, then if I am still struggling I look over the examples in the module to see what I miss. Then and only when I've exhausted all my other options I begin googling. A very thoroughly self reliant model though I fear it may not be the most time effective style.
